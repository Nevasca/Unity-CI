# Unity-CI
 Simple project for testing CI workflow using [GameCI](https://game.ci/ "GameCI").

If you know nothing about GitHub actions, watching CoderDave [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLB5MY9BBa4&ab_channel=CoderDave "video tutorial") is a good start.

Create a public repository to study and experiment things, since it does not consume any quota. You can reuse the jobs and actions on private repositories later.

A shout out to [Godoy](https://github.com/RicardoQLG "Godoy") for insisting me on studying CI/CD, it is really worth the effort.
